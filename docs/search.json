Models typically serve two purposes: prediction inference. model allows us predict value response given particular values predictors. Also, model allows us make inferences relationship response predictors.models used built principles. models better inference others better prediction. models better qualitative responses others better quantitative responses. Also, many models require making assumptions nature relationship variables. assumptions violated, model loses usefulness. machine learning course, wide array models discussed used purpose prediction.block, focus linear models use linear regression produce evaluate model. Linear regression powerful statistical technique. Many people familiarity regression just reading news, graphs straight lines overlaid scatterplots, much like last chapter. Linear models can used prediction evaluate whether linear relationship two numerical variables.Suppose interested exploring relationship one response variable (\\(Y\\)) one predictor variable (\\(X\\)). can postulate linear relationship two:\n\\[\nY=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 X\n\\]linear model can expanded include multiple predictor variables:\n\\[\nY=\\beta_0+\\beta_1X_1+\\beta_2X_2+...+\\beta_pX_p\n\\]model often referred linear regression model.
