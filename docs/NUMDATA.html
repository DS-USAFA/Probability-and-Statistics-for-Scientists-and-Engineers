<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Numerical Data</h2>
<p>This lesson introduces techniques for exploring and summarizing numerical variables, and the <code>email50</code> and <code>mlb</code> data sets from the <strong>openintro</strong> package and a subset of <code>county_complete</code> from <code>usdata</code> provide rich opportunities for examples. Recall that outcomes of numerical variables are numbers on which it is reasonable to perform basic arithmetic operations. For example, the <code>pop2010</code> variable, which represents the populations of counties in 2010, is numerical since we can sensibly discuss the difference or ratio of the populations in two counties. On the other hand, area codes and zip codes are not numerical.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.1</span> Scatterplots for paired data</h3>
<p>A <strong>scatterplot</strong> provides a case-by-case view of data for two numerical variables. In Figure <a href="NUMDATA.html#fig:scat5-fig">5.1</a>, we again present a scatterplot used to examine how federal spending and poverty were related in the <code>county</code> data set.</p>

<p>Another scatterplot is shown in Figure <a href="NUMDATA.html#fig:scat52-fig">5.2</a>, comparing the number of line breaks <code>line_breaks</code> and number of characters <code>num_char</code> in emails for the <code>email50</code> data set. In any scatterplot, each point represents a single case. Since there are 50 cases in <code>email50</code>, there are 50 points in Figure <a href="NUMDATA.html#fig:scat52-fig">5.2</a>.</p>

<p>To put the number of characters in perspective, this paragraph has 357 characters. Looking at Figure <a href="NUMDATA.html#fig:scat52-fig">5.2</a>, it seems that some emails are incredibly long! Upon further investigation, we would actually find that most of the long emails use the HTML format, which means most of the characters in those emails are used to format the email rather than provide text.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.2</span> Dot plots and the mean</h3>
<p>Sometimes two variables are one too many: only one variable may be of interest. In these cases, a dot plot provides the most basic of displays. A <strong>dot plot</strong> is a one-variable scatterplot; an example using the number of characters from 50 emails is shown in Figure <a href="NUMDATA.html#fig:dot5-fig">5.4</a>.</p>
<div class="figure"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:dot5-fig"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 5.4: A dot plot of <code>num_char</code> for the <code>email50</code> data set.
</p>
</div>
<p>The <strong>mean</strong>, sometimes called the average, is a common way to measure the center of a <strong>distribution</strong> of data. To find the mean number of characters in the 50 emails, we add up all the character counts and divide by the number of emails. For computational convenience, the number of characters is listed in the thousands and rounded to the first decimal.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\bar{x} = \frac{21.7 + 7.0 + \cdots + 15.8}{50} = 11.6\]</span></p>
<p>The sample mean is often labeled <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>, a bar over the letter, and the letter <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is being used as a generic placeholder for the variable of interest, <code>num_char</code>.</p>
<blockquote>

What was <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> in this sample of emails?<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>email50</code> data set is a sample from a larger population of emails that were received in January and March. We could compute a mean for this population in the same way as the sample mean. However, there is a difference in notation: the population mean has a special label: <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. The symbol <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is the Greek letter <em>mu</em> and represents the average of all observations in the population. Sometimes a subscript, such as <span class="math inline">\(_x\)</span>, is used to represent which variable the population mean refers to, e.g. <span class="math inline">\(\mu_x\)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Example</em>:
The average number of characters across all emails can be estimated using the sample data. Based on the sample of 50 emails, what would be a reasonable estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\mu_x\)</span>, the mean number of characters in all emails in the <code>email</code> data set? (Recall that <code>email50</code> is a sample from <code>email</code>.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sample mean, 11.6, may provide a reasonable estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\mu_x\)</span>. While this number will not be perfect, it provides a <strong>point estimate</strong> of the population mean. Later in the text, we will develop tools to characterize the accuracy of point estimates, and we will find that point estimates based on larger samples tend to be more accurate than those based on smaller samples.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Example</em>:<br />
We might like to compute the average income per person in the US. To do so, we might first think to take the mean of the per capita incomes from the 3,143 counties in the <code>county</code> data set. What would be a better approach?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>county</code> data set is special in that each county actually represents many individual people. If we were to simply average across the <code>income</code> variable, we would be treating counties with 5,000 and 5,000,000 residents equally in the calculations. Instead, we should compute the total income for each county, add up all the counties’ totals, and then divide by the number of people in all the counties. If we completed these steps with the <code>county</code> data, we would find that the per capita income for the US is $27,348.43. Had we computed the <em>simple</em> mean of per capita income across counties, the result would have been just $22,504.70!</p>
<p>This previous example used what is called a <strong>weighted mean</strong>, which will be a key topic in the probability section. As a look ahead, the probability mass function gives the population proportions of each value and thus to find the population mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, we will use a weighted mean.</p>

<div id="histograms-and-shape" class="section level3" number="5.2.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.3</span> Histograms and shape</h3>
<p>Dot plots show the exact value of each observation. This is useful for small data sets, but they can become hard to read with larger samples. Rather than showing the value of each observation, think of the value as belonging to a <em>bin</em>. For example, in the <code>email50</code> data set, we create a table of counts for the number of cases with character counts between 0 and 5,000, then the number of cases between 5,000 and 10,000, and so on. Observations that fall on the boundary of a bin (e.g. 5,000) are allocated to the lower bin. This tabulation is shown below.</p>
<pre><code>## 
##   (0,5]  (5,10] (10,15] (15,20] (20,25] (25,30] (30,35] (35,40] (40,45] (45,50] 
##      19      12       6       2       3       5       0       0       2       0 
## (50,55] (55,60] (60,65] 
##       0       0       1</code></pre>
<p>These binned counts are plotted as bars in Figure <a href="NUMDATA.html#fig:hist5-fig">5.5</a> into what is called a <strong>histogram</strong>.</p>
<div class="figure"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:hist5-fig"></span>
<img src="05-Numerical-Data_files/figure-html/hist5-fig-1.png" alt="A histogram of `num_char`. This distribution is very strongly skewed to the right." width="672" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 5.5: A histogram of <code>num_char</code>. This distribution is very strongly skewed to the right.
</p>
</div>
<p>Histograms provide a view of the <strong>data density</strong>. Higher bars represent where the data are relatively more dense. For instance, there are many more emails between 0 and 10,000 characters than emails between 10,000 and 20,000 characters in the data set. The bars make it easy to see how the density of the data changes relative to the number of characters.</p>
<p>Histograms are especially convenient for describing the shape of the data distribution. Figure <a href="NUMDATA.html#fig:hist5-fig">5.5</a> shows that most emails have a relatively small number of characters, while fewer emails have a very large number of characters. When data trail off to the right in this way and have a longer right <strong>tail</strong>, the shape is said to be <strong>right skewed</strong>.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>Data sets with the reverse characteristic – a long, thin tail to the left – are said to be <strong>left skewed</strong>. We also say that such a distribution has a long left tail. Data sets that show roughly equal trailing off in both directions are called <strong>symmetric</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Long tails to identify skew</strong><br />
When data trail off in one direction, the distribution has a <strong>long tail</strong>. If a distribution has a long left tail, it is left skewed. If a distribution has a long right tail, it is right skewed.</p>

<em>What must we give <code>R</code> for it to do this?</em></p>

<p>In addition to looking at whether a distribution is skewed or symmetric, histograms can be used to identify modes. A <strong>mode</strong> is represented by a prominent peak in the distribution.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> There is only one prominent peak in the histogram of <code>num_char</code>.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="NUMDATA.html#fig:histmulti-fig">5.6</a> show histograms that have one, two, or three prominent peaks. Such distributions are called <strong>unimodal</strong>, <strong>bimodal</strong>, and <strong>multimodal</strong>, respectively. Any distribution with more than 2 prominent peaks is called multimodal. Notice that there was one prominent peak in the unimodal distribution with a second less prominent peak that was not counted since it only differs from its neighboring bins by a few observations.</p>

<p><strong>Looking for modes</strong><br />
Looking for modes isn’t about finding a clear and correct answer about the number of modes in a distribution, which is why <strong>prominent</strong> is not rigorously defined in these notes.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.4</span> Variance and standard deviation</h3>
<p>The mean is used to describe the center of a data set, but the <em>variability</em> in the data is also important. Here, we introduce two measures of variability: the <strong>variance</strong> and the <strong>standard deviation</strong>. Both of these are very useful in data analysis, even though the formulas are a bit tedious to calculate by hand. The standard deviation is the easier of the two to conceptually understand, and it roughly describes how far away the typical observation is from the mean. Equation <a href="NUMDATA.html#eq:var5">(5.2)</a> is the equation for sample variance. We will demonstrate it with data so that the notation is easier to understand.</p>

\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>If we square these deviations and then take an average, the result is equal to the <strong>sample variance</strong>, denoted by <span class="math inline">\(s_{}^2\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
s_{}^2 &amp;= \frac{10.1_{}^2 + (-4.6)_{}^2 + (-11.0)_{}^2 + \cdots + 4.2_{}^2}{50-1} \\
    &amp;= \frac{102.01 + 21.16 + 121.00 + \cdots + 17.64}{49} \\
    &amp;= 172.44
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>We divide by <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span>, rather than dividing by <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, when computing the variance; you need not worry about this mathematical nuance yet. Notice that squaring the deviations does two things. First, it makes large values much larger, seen by comparing <span class="math inline">\(10.1^2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((-4.6)^2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((-11.0)^2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(4.2^2\)</span>. Second, it gets rid of any negative signs.</p>
<p>The sample <strong>standard deviation</strong> <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is the square root of the variance:
<span class="math display">\[s=\sqrt{172.44} = 13.13\]</span>
The sample standard deviation of the number of characters in an email is 13.13 thousand. A subscript of <span class="math inline">\(_x\)</span> may be added to the variance and standard deviation, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(s_x^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s_x^{}\)</span>, as a reminder that these are the variance and standard deviation of the observations represented by <span class="math inline">\(x_1^{}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_2^{}\)</span>, …, <span class="math inline">\(x_n^{}\)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(_{x}\)</span> subscript is usually omitted when it is clear which data the variance or standard deviation is referencing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Variance and standard deviation</strong><br />
The variance is roughly the average squared distance from the mean. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance and describes how close the data are to the mean.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Formulas and methods used to compute the variance and standard deviation for a population are similar to those used for a sample.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> However, like the mean, the population values have special symbols: <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{}^2\)</span> for the variance and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> for the standard deviation. The symbol <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is the Greek letter <em>sigma</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tip: standard deviation describes variability</strong><br />
Focus on the conceptual meaning of the standard deviation as a descriptor of variability rather than the formulas. Usually 70% of the data will be within one standard deviation of the mean and about 95% will be within two standard deviations. However, as we have seen, these percentages are not strict rules.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise</strong>:<br />
Earlier the concept of shape of a distribution was introduced.

<p>In practice, the variance and standard deviation are sometimes used as a means to an end, where the <em>end</em> is being able to accurately estimate the uncertainty associated with a sample statistic. For example, later in the course we will use the variance and standard deviation to assess how close the sample mean is to the population mean.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.2.5</span> Box plots, quartiles, and the median</h3>
<p>A <strong>box plot</strong> summarizes a data set using five statistics while also plotting unusual observations. Figure <a href="NUMDATA.html#fig:box-fig">5.10</a> provides a vertical dot plot alongside a box plot of the <code>num_char</code> variable from the <code>email50</code> data set.</p>
<div class="figure"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:box-fig"></span>
<img src="05-Numerical-Data_files/figure-html/box-fig-1.png" alt="A vertical dot plot next to a labeled box plot for the number of characters in 50 emails. The median (6,890), splits the data into the bottom 50% and the top 50%, marked in the dot plot by horizontal dashes and open circles, respectively." width="672" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 5.10: A vertical dot plot next to a labeled box plot for the number of characters in 50 emails. The median (6,890), splits the data into the bottom 50% and the top 50%, marked in the dot plot by horizontal dashes and open circles, respectively.
</p>
</div>
<p>The first step in building a box plot is drawing a dark line denoting the <strong>median</strong>, which splits the data in half. Figure <a href="NUMDATA.html#fig:box-fig">5.10</a> shows 50% of the data falling below the median (red dashes) and the other 50% falling above the median (blue open circles). There are 50 character counts in the data set (an even number) so the data are perfectly split into two groups of 25. We take the median in this case to be the average of the two observations closest to the <span class="math inline">\(50^{th}\)</span> percentile: <span class="math inline">\((\text{6,768} + \text{7,012}) / 2 = \text{6,890}\)</span>. When there are an odd number of observations, there will be exactly one observation that splits the data into two halves, and in this case that observation is the median (no average needed).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Median: the number in the middle</strong><br />
If the data are ordered from smallest to largest, the <strong>median</strong> is the observation right in the middle. If there are an even number of observations, there will be two values in the middle, and the median is taken as their average.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second step in building a box plot is drawing a rectangle to represent the middle 50% of the data. The total length of the box, shown vertically in Figure <a href="NUMDATA.html#fig:box-fig">5.10</a>, is called the <strong>interquartile range</strong> (IQR, for short). It, like the standard deviation, is a measure of variability in data. The more variable the data, the larger the standard deviation and IQR. The two boundaries of the box are called the <strong>first quartile</strong> (the <span class="math inline">\(25^{th}\)</span> percentile, i.e. 25% of the data fall below this value) and the <strong>third quartile</strong> (the <span class="math inline">\(75^{th}\)</span> percentile), and these are often labeled <span class="math inline">\(Q_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q_3\)</span>, respectively.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interquartile range (IQR)</strong><br />
The IQR is the length of the box in a box plot. It is computed as
<span class="math display">\[ IQR = Q_3 - Q_1 \]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(Q_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q_3\)</span> are the <span class="math inline">\(25^{th}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(75^{th}\)</span> percentiles.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>:<br />
What percent of the data fall between <span class="math inline">\(Q_1\)</span> and the median? What percent is between the median and <span class="math inline">\(Q_3\)</span>?<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Extending out from the box, the <strong>whiskers</strong> attempt to capture the data outside of the box, however, their reach is never allowed to be more than <span class="math inline">\(1.5\times IQR\)</span>.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> They capture everything within this reach. In Figure <a href="NUMDATA.html#fig:box-fig">5.10</a>, the upper whisker does not extend to the last three points, which are beyond <span class="math inline">\(Q_3 + 1.5\times IQR\)</span>, and so it extends only to the last point below this limit. The lower whisker stops at the lowest value, 33, since there is no additional data to reach; the lower whisker’s limit is not shown in the figure because the plot does not extend down to <span class="math inline">\(Q_1 - 1.5\times IQR\)</span>. In a sense, the box is like the body of the box plot and the whiskers are like its arms trying to reach the rest of the data.</p>
<p>Any observation that lies beyond the whiskers is labeled with a dot. The purpose of labeling these points – instead of just extending the whiskers to the minimum and maximum observed values – is to help identify any observations that appear to be unusually distant from the rest of the data. Unusually distant observations are called <strong>outliers</strong>. In this case, it would be reasonable to classify the emails with character counts of 41,623, 42,793, and 64,401 as outliers since they are numerically distant from most of the data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Outliers are extreme</strong><br />
An <strong>outlier</strong> is an observation that is extreme relative to the rest of the data.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Why it is important to look for outliers</strong><br />
Examination of data for possible outliers serves many useful purposes, including<br />
1. Identifying <strong>strong skew</strong> in the distribution.<br />
2. Identifying data collection or entry errors. For instance, we re-examined the email purported to have 64,401 characters to ensure this value was accurate.<br />
3. Providing insight into interesting properties of the data.</p>

<p>When data are very strongly skewed, we sometimes transform them so they are easier to model. Consider the histogram of salaries for Major League Baseball players’ salaries from 2010, which is shown in Figure <a href="NUMDATA.html#fig:hist510-fig">5.12</a>.</p>

<p>There are some standard transformations that are often applied when much of the data cluster near zero (relative to the larger values in the data set) and all observations are positive. A <strong>transformation</strong> is a rescaling of the data using a function. For instance, a plot of the natural logarithm<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> of player salaries results in a new histogram in Figure <a href="NUMDATA.html#fig:hist512-fig">5.13</a>. Transformed data are sometimes easier to work with when applying statistical models because the transformed data are much less skewed and outliers are usually less extreme.</p>

<p>Transformations can also be applied to one or both variables in a scatterplot. A scatterplot of the <code>line_breaks</code> and <code>num_char</code> variables is shown in Figure <a href="NUMDATA.html#fig:scat52-fig">5.2</a> above. We can see a positive association between the variables and that many observations are clustered near zero. Later in this text, we might want to use a straight line to model the data. However, we’ll find that the data in their current state cannot be modeled very well. Figure <a href="NUMDATA.html#fig:scat513-fig">5.14</a> shows a scatterplot where both the <code>line_breaks</code> and <code>num_char</code> variables have been transformed using a log (base <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>) transformation. While there is a positive association in each plot, the transformed data show a steadier trend, which is easier to model than the untransformed data.</p>

<p>Transformations other than the logarithm can be useful, too. For instance, the square root (<span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{\text{original observation}}\)</span>) and inverse (<span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\text{original observation}}\)</span>) are used by statisticians. Common goals in transforming data are to see the data structure differently, reduce skew, assist in modeling, or straighten a nonlinear relationship in a scatterplot.</p>

<li id="fn35"><p>Answers may vary. Scatterplots are helpful in quickly spotting associations between variables, whether those associations represent simple or more complex relationships.<a href="NUMDATA.html#fnref35" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn36"><p>Subset of data from <a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v1n1/datasets.lock.html" class="uri">http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v1n1/datasets.lock.html</a><a href="NUMDATA.html#fnref36" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn37"><p>Consider the case where your vertical axis represents something ``good’’ and your horizontal axis represents something that is only good in moderation. Health and water consumption fit this description since water becomes toxic when consumed in excessive quantities.<a href="NUMDATA.html#fnref37" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn38"><p><span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> corresponds to the number of characters in the first email in the sample (21.7, in thousands), <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span> to the number of characters in the second email (7.0, in thousands), and <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> corresponds to the number of characters in the <span class="math inline">\(i^{th}\)</span> email in the data set.<a href="NUMDATA.html#fnref38" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn39"><p>The sample size was <span class="math inline">\(n=50\)</span>.<a href="NUMDATA.html#fnref39" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn40"><p>Other ways to describe data that are skewed to the right: <strong>skewed to the right</strong>, <strong>skewed to the high end</strong>, or <strong>skewed to the positive end</strong>.<a href="NUMDATA.html#fnref40" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn41"><p>The skew is visible in all both plots, though the dot plot is the least useful.<a href="NUMDATA.html#fnref41" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn42"><p>Character counts for individual emails.<a href="NUMDATA.html#fnref42" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn43"><p>Another definition of mode, which is not typically used in statistics, is the value with the most occurrences. It is common to have <em>no</em> observations with the same value in a data set, which makes this other definition useless for many real data sets.<a href="NUMDATA.html#fnref43" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn44"><p>There might be two height groups visible in the data set: one of the students and one of the adults. That is, the data are probably bimodal. But it could be multimodal because within each group we may be able to see a difference in males and females.<a href="NUMDATA.html#fnref44" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn45"><p>The only difference is that the population variance has a division by <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> instead of <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span>.<a href="NUMDATA.html#fnref45" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn46"><p>Starting with Figure <a href="NUMDATA.html#fig:hist53-fig">5.7</a>, the three figures show three distributions that look quite different, but all have the same mean, variance, and standard deviation. Using modality, we can distinguish between the first plot (bimodal) and the last two (unimodal). Using skewness, we can distinguish between the last plot (right skewed) and the first two. While a picture, like a histogram, tells a more complete story, we can use modality and shape (symmetry/skew) to characterize basic information about a distribution.<a href="NUMDATA.html#fnref46" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn47"><p>The distribution of email character counts is unimodal and very strongly skewed to the high end. Many of the counts fall near the mean at 11,600, and most fall within one standard deviation (13,130) of the mean. There is one exceptionally long email with about 65,000 characters.<a href="NUMDATA.html#fnref47" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn48"><p>Since <span class="math inline">\(Q_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q_3\)</span> capture the middle 50% of the data and the median splits the data in the middle, 25% of the data fall between <span class="math inline">\(Q_1\)</span> and the median, and another 25% falls between the median and <span class="math inline">\(Q_3\)</span>.<a href="NUMDATA.html#fnref48" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn49"><p>While the choice of exactly 1.5 is arbitrary, it is the most commonly used value for box plots.<a href="NUMDATA.html#fnref49" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn50"><p>That occasionally there may be very long emails.<a href="NUMDATA.html#fnref50" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn51"><p>These visual estimates will vary a little from one person to the next: <span class="math inline">\(Q_1\)</span> ~ 3,000, <span class="math inline">\(Q_3\)</span> ~ 15,000, IQR=<span class="math inline">\(Q_3 - Q_1\)</span> ~ 12,000. (The true values: <span class="math inline">\(Q_1=\)</span> 2,536, <span class="math inline">\(Q_3=\)</span> 15,411, IQR = 12,875.)<a href="NUMDATA.html#fnref51" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn52"><p>(a) Mean is affected more. (b) Standard deviation is affected more.<a href="NUMDATA.html#fnref52" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn53"><p>The median and IQR are only sensitive to numbers near <span class="math inline">\(Q_1\)</span>, the median, and <span class="math inline">\(Q_3\)</span>. Since values in these regions are relatively stable – there aren’t large jumps between observations – the median and IQR estimates are also quite stable.<a href="NUMDATA.html#fnref53" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn54"><p>Buyers of a <em>regular car</em> should be concerned about the median price. High-end car sales can drastically inflate the mean price while the median will be more robust to the influence of those sales.<a href="NUMDATA.html#fnref54" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn55"><p>Most of the data are collected into one bin in the histogram and the data are so strongly skewed that many details in the data are obscured.<a href="NUMDATA.html#fnref55" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn56"><p>Statisticians often write the natural logarithm as <span class="math inline">\(\log\)</span>. You might be more familiar with it being written as <span class="math inline">\(\ln\)</span>.<a href="NUMDATA.html#fnref56" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
