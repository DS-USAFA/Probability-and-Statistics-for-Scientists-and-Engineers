This book is based on the notes we created for our students as part of a one semester course on probability and statistics. We developed these notes from three primary resources. The most important is the Openintro Introductory Statistics with Randomization and Simulation book. In parts we have used their notes and homework problems. However, in most cases we have altered their work to fit our needs. The second most important book for our work is Introductory to Probability and Statistics with R. Finally, we have used some examples, code, and ideas from the first addition of Prium's book Foundations and Applications of Statistics: An Introduction Using R.

This book used R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown).
